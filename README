So, uh, yeah. Let's go with a GPL license, which I'll upload in a bit.

Basically, installer.py is the text-based installer, and display.py is my god-awful attempt at a gui for it. In fact, it doesn't even work yet.

You'll need 'unetbootin' in order to use this, as this is basically just a front-end for it.

So, to use it, just download the ubuntu and fedora ISOs (and change the ISO file names in installer.py if necessary) and run python installer.py. Then plug in a flash drive and it should be picked up automatically and begin asking you questions. I think the most it'll ask is 4 (but I don't remember), and then it'll run unetbootin and install your chosen ISO on the drive.

Yeah, I know the code is god-awful. I have no idea what I was thinking when I wrote it. But at least it's mildly readable.
